          <p>trippit has been an idea I had for the longest time. An idea that came from an urge to share my experiences with others and from my love for travel. After getting tired of waiting I finally got the project going with help from my friends. </p>

          <p>I took the branding into my own hands with logos, UI/UX and Front-End.</p>

          <p>ttrippit is a project that I thought would just be a side project but as we kept on working on it, our ideas for it kept on growing and so did the work. But that’s the best part, being able to work on something that you’re passionate about.

          For all those who don’t know what trippit is, it is a site for travel enthusiasts to share their experiences and for you to get inspired by other people’s experiences. 

          The essence of what we wanted trippit to be was easy. We wanted it to be easy for people to post things, easy for people to browse the site and easy for people to understand what’s going on.
